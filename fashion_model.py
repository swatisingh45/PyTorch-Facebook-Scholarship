# Here you should define your network.
# As with MNIST, each image is 28x28 which is a total of 784 pixels, and there are 10 classes.
# You should include at least one hidden layer. We suggest you use ReLU activations for the layers and to return the logits or log-softmax from the forward pass.
# It's up to you how many layers you add and the size of those layers.

# TODO: Define your network architecture here
